.. py:class:: SetupWindow(**kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`pyglet.window.Window`

   Platform-independent application window.

   A window is a "heavyweight" object occupying operating system resources.
   The "client" or "content" area of a window is filled entirely with
   an OpenGL viewport.  Applications have no access to operating system
   widgets or controls; all rendering must be done via OpenGL.

   Windows may appear as floating regions or can be set to fill an entire
   screen (fullscreen).  When floating, windows may appear borderless or
   decorated with a platform-specific frame (including, for example, the
   title bar, minimize and close buttons, resize handles, and so on).

   While it is possible to set the location of a window, it is recommended
   that applications allow the platform to place it according to local
   conventions.  This will ensure it is not obscured by other windows,
   and appears on an appropriate screen for the user.

   To render into a window, you must first call `switch_to`, to make
   it the current OpenGL context.  If you use only one window in the
   application, there is no need to do this.
