Import VAMToolbox modules and numpy.

Create a :py:class:`VAMToolbox.geometry.TargetGeometry` from a .stl file by specifying the ``stlfilename`` and ``resolution`` i.e. the number of slices in the z-axis. When overprint optimization is desired, use the ``print_bodies`` kwarg to specify which bodies are to be printed (i.e. a list of the bodies in the model *omitting* the insert bodies). In this case, body to printed is body 2.

.. note::
    The 3D CAD model should be created with separate bodies e.g. when extruding a new feature, you can choose to create a new body instead of creating a union with the existing body and the new feature. This has been tested with Autodesk Inventor and Solidworks. Some 3D solid modeling software may not have this capability.

Finally, show the target with the :py:meth:`VAMToolbox.geometry.Volume.show` method and use the ``show_insert`` kwarg to show the insert bodies in a red color.

Create the :py:class:`VAMToolbox.geometry.ProjectionGeometry` object. First, the ``angles`` array is created by using `numpy.linspace <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.linspace.html>`_ to create 1D array of evenly spaced angles at which to perform projection. 

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/3Doverprint.py
    :lines: 9-11

Create an :py:class:`VAMToolbox.optimize.Options` object and run optimization. The :py:class:`VAMToolbox.optimize.Options` object holds the parameters used by the :py:func:`VAMToolbox.optimize.optimize` function.

.. tip:: Hover the mouse pointer over either slice and scroll to slice through the 3D voxel array at different z and x indices.
