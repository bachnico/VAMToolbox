abstract = {Biofabrication technologies, including stereolithography and extrusion-based printing, are revolutionizing the creation of complex engineered tissues. The current paradigm in bioprinting relies on the additive layer-by-layer deposition and assembly of repetitive building blocks, typically cell-laden hydrogel fibers or voxels, single cells, or cellular aggregates. The scalability of these additive manufacturing technologies is limited by their printing velocity, as lengthy biofabrication processes impair cell functionality. Overcoming such limitations, the volumetric bioprinting of clinically relevant sized, anatomically shaped constructs, in a time frame ranging from seconds to tens of seconds is described. An optical-tomography-inspired printing approach, based on visible light projection, is developed to generate cell-laden tissue constructs with high viability ({\textgreater}85{\%}) from gelatin-based photoresponsive hydrogels. Free-form architectures, difficult to reproduce with conventional printing, are obtained, including anatomically correct trabecular bone models with embedded angiogenic sprouts and meniscal grafts. The latter undergoes maturation in vitro as the bioprinted chondroprogenitor cells synthesize neo-fibrocartilage matrix. Moreover, free-floating structures are generated, as demonstrated by printing functional hydrogel-based ball-and-cage fluidic valves. Volumetric bioprinting permits the creation of geometrically complex, centimeter-scale constructs at an unprecedented printing velocity, opening new avenues for upscaling the production of hydrogel-based constructs and for their application in tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and soft robotics.},

abstract = {The vast majority of additive manufacturing processes today operate by printing voxels serially point-by-point to build up a 3D part. In some higher throughput techniques, for example optical printing methods such as projection stereolithography [1], [2], parts are printed layer-by-layer by curing full 2D (very thin in one dimension) layers of the 3D part in each print step. In this work, we demonstrate a new technique which prints entire parts all at once and eliminates layering. The approach, termed Computed Axial Lithography (CAL), is based on tomographic reconstruction, with mathematical optimization to generate a set of projections to optically define an arbitrary dose distribution within a target volume and to cure the entire volume simultaneously. Volume-at-once fabrication of complex geometries is achieved using a custom system built from a DLP projector and a rotating resin volume. This technique can be used to expand the range of printable geometries in additive manufacturing and relax constraints on factors such as overhangs in topology optimization. The method also vastly increases print speed for 3D parts. We show complex and overhanging geometries printed in situ without layering.},

abstract = {Ceramics are highly chemically, thermally, and mechanically resistant. These remarkable propertiers make them useful across multiple industries; but also, difficult to mold into complex shapes. A possibility to make convoluted ceramic parts is to use preceramic polymers (PCPs) in liquid form. The PCP resin is first solidified in a desired geometry and then transformed into ceramic compounds through a pyrolysis step that preserves the shape. Light-based additive manufacturing (AM) is a promising route to achieve solidification of the PCP resin. Different approaches, such as stereolithography, have already been proposed but they all rely on a layer-by-layer printing process which limits printing speed and object geometry. Herein, the fabrication of complex 3D centimeter-scale ceramic parts by using tomographic volumetric printing is presented, which is fast and offers a high-resolution and geometrical design freedom. First, a photosensitive polysiloxane preceramic resin that is solidified by projecting light patterns from multiple angles is formulated. Then, the obtained 3D printed parts are converted into ceramics by pyrolysis. The strength of this approach is demonstrated through the fabrication of smooth, dense microcomponents exhibiting overhangs and hollow geometries without the need of supporting structures. Their resistance to thermal stress and harsh chemical treatments is characterized.},

Owing to the advent of photo-curable resins, several fully volumetric light-based techniques have been recently developed to push further the resolution and speed limitations of 3D printing. However, these new approaches only work with homogeneous and relatively transparent resins so that the incident light patterns used for photo-polymerization are not impacted along their propagation through the material. Herein, we describe a strategy to print in scattering materials. It consists of characterizing how light is distorted by the curable resin and then applying a digital correction to the light patterns to counteract the effect of scattering. Using a tomographic volumetric printer, we experimentally demonstrate the importance of taking light scattering into account when computing the projected patterns and show that our applied correction significantly improves printability, even when the object size exceeds the scattering mean free path of light.},

In these approaches, a 3D object is typically built by successive polymerization of 2D layers in a photocurable resin. A recently demonstrated technique, however, uses tomographic dose patterning to establish a 3D light dose distribution within a cylindrical glass vial of photoresin. Lensing distortion from the cylindrical vial is currently mitigated by either an index matching bath around the print volume or a cylindrical lens. In this work, we show that these hardware approaches to distortion correction are unnecessary. Instead, we demonstrate how the lensing effect can be computationally corrected by resampling the parallel-beam radon transform into an aberrated geometry. We also demonstrate a more general application of our computational approach by correcting for non-telecentricity inherent in most optical projection systems. We expect that our results will underpin a more simple and flexible class of tomographic 3D printers where deviations from the assumed parallel-beam projection geometry are rectified computationally.},

abstract = {Glass is increasingly desired as a material for manufacturing complex microscopic geometries, from the micro-optics in compact consumer products to microfluidic systems for chemical synthesis and biological analyses. As the size, geometric, surface roughness, and mechanical strength requirements of glass evolve, conventional processing methods are challenged. We introduce microscale computed axial lithography (micro-CAL) of fused silica components, by tomographically illuminating a photopolymer-silica nanocomposite that is then sintered. We fabricated three-dimensional microfluidics with internal diameters of 150 micrometers, free-form micro-optical elements with a surface roughness of 6 nanometers, and complex high-strength trusses and lattice structures with minimum feature sizes of 50 micrometers. As a high-speed, layer-free digital light manufacturing process, micro-CAL can process nanocomposites with high solids content and high geometric freedom, enabling new device structures and applications.},
